# tictactoe
simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe as a task from udemy course

 The game is developed in C# and consists of a console application where players can play against each other.
 
 A TicTacToe class containing methods for checking the game state, displaying the game board, and handling player moves.
The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid stored in a two-dimensional array.
Players take turns selecting fields on the board, with 'X' and 'O' markers representing their moves.
The game continues until one player achieves a winning pattern (three consecutive markers in a row, column, or diagonal) or the board is filled with no winner (a draw).
The project also includes basic input validation to ensure that players input valid moves within the range of available fields on the board
